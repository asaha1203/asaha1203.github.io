      <p>
        Hey! I'm Amit Saha, a third-year undergraduate student at Georgia Tech studying computer science and mathematics. If you'd like to reach out, find my contact information <a href="contact.html">here</a>.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <b>Research: </b>Broadly, I like working on theoretical problems with applications in fairness, safety, and privacy. More specifically, I like to exploit tools from 
        {<span style="color:#B22222;">information theory, high dimensional probability, algorithmic sampling</span>}
        as primitives to understand problems in 
        {<span style="color:#228B22;">statistical learning theory, deep learning</span>},
        usually under the constraint of <span style="color:#1E90FF;">differential privacy</span>. Learn more about my current projects and previous work <a href="papers.html">here</a>.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Currently, I work under <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/panli-purdue" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pan Li</a>, <a href="https://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/wibisono/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Andre Wibisono</a>, and <a href="https://www.ashiawilson.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ashia Wilson</a>, and collaborate closely with Yinan Huang, Rongzhe Wei, Eli Chien, Jan Schuchardt, and Vishwak Srinivasan. I'm deeply grateful for the guidance and support I've received from them.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Outside of my main research interests, I am deeply invested in {<span style="color:purple;">systems for machine learning</span>, <span style="color:purple;">AI safety</span>, <span style="color:purple;">autoformalization for mathematics via language models</span>}, although I do not actively work on research in these fields. To this end, I am a contributor to the Marin project, an active member of the AISI community at Georgia Tech, and regularly make use of autoformalization tools for my own (mathematical) research. 
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <b>Academics:</b> I credit much of my research to ideas first learnt in different classes at Georgia Tech. If you're interested, check out my coursework <a href="courses.html">here</a>.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <b>Industry Experience:</b> I spent two <a href="adobe.html">wonderful summers</a> working at Adobe on the Camera Raw team as a machine learning research intern under Michelle Qi and David Franzen. 
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <b>Everything else:  </b>At last &mdash; nonacademically &mdash; I enjoy making <a href="pizza.html">pizza</a>, reading, and listening to <a href="too_much_music.html">music <i>all the time</i></a>.
